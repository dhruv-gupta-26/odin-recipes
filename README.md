# odin-recipes
This is the first assignment-cum-project under the Odin Project web development course.
As part of this assignment, I will try to brush up on the HTML Skills gained.
I've tried to put two recipes in this. And have written easy to follow steps to make them.

Images are taken from Pinterest website and all the credit of the images go with their respective owners.
